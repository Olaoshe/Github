    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>To start with I drew a couple of mock up designs of what I wanted the websites to look like, I chose to use pink as a base colour (because I like it) and researched websites that use pink as their background colour; quite a few websites that were pink used a hot pink that was visually unappealing so I decided on using a very light pink so that I could utilise black and silver as the accent colours. I initially wanted to implement a gif as part of the website to separate the navigation system and the website bio. I wanted a simpler gif that didn’t distract the user too much, so I looked up gifs that were white sparkles.</p>
    <p>For the navigation design I used a simple format and made the font white, but I also highlighted the text with a light silver colour to make it stand out against the pink, as for the font I used a visual studio font called fantasy to differentiate the navigation and the rest of the text.</p>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>The first problem I encountered whilst trying to run the website with the CSS was a syntax error caused by my spelling of the name of the CSS sheets which didn’t match, and it took me over an hour to fix it.</p>
